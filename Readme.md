A BeepBeep toolbox for runitme verification in smart homes
==============================================
This repository is the results of a research work for reframing runtime verification to overcome the assumptions on state and time in smart home environments.

This repository contains an extension to the [BeepBeep](https://liflab.github.io/beepbeep-3) event stream processing engine for the manipulation of sensor events produced by smart home
platforms such as [NEARS](https://domus.recherche.usherbrooke.ca/nears/) and [Orange4Home](https://amiqual4home.inria.fr/en/orange4home/).

To learn more about BeepBeep, a [presentation](https://www.slideshare.net/sylvainhalle/event-stream-processing-with-beepbeep-3-258079731) is available, as well as a complete (and free) [textbook](https://www.puq.ca/catalogue/livres/event-stream-processing-with-beep-beep-3663.html).


Using the extension
-------------------

You can use the toolbox by simply downloading the latest precompiled release of teh project. 

The library is stand-alone: in addition to the new processors and functions it defines, it bundles BeepBeep and all the [palettes](https://github.com/liflab/beepbeep-3-palettes) it needs to operate. No other JAR file is needed.

### In Java

To use the toolbox in a Java project, simply add the library to the Java classpath or as a dependency in your IDE.
